                    <h1>Java<b>8+ Years</b></h1>
                    <p>I started with Java by modding Minecraft, though I haven't modded Minecraft in a while. I also used Java during my time in both the First Tech Competition in middle school and in the First Robotics Competition in high school.<br><br>I have multiple projects I have uploaded to Github made with Java.</p>

                    <h1>Python<b>8+ Years</b></h1>
                    <p>I learned Python by making games with it, mostly using Pygame. I have used Python to participate in several game jams over the years, though I have taken them off of my Itch account to clean it up.</p>

                    <h1>JavaScript<b>8+ Years</b></h1>
                    <p>I learned JavaScript by making games with it as well. When making games with JavaScript, I would usually use a canvas as display. One game I made in high school is a Swerve Drive Simulator for my First Robotics Challenge team, which is playable <a href="https://www.frc3218.org/swerve-simulator">here</a>.</p>
